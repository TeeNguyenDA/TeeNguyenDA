## Hi 👋 My name is Tee.
### For folks who've known me before, it's Thanh here 😊

I'm a data analyst (with marketing background) dubbed 'a dream chaser'🦸 Adapting to changes and learning always is crucial to me 🍹 My personal jouney from 🇻🇳 - 🇵🇭 - 🇨🇦 means a lot to me! Now I'm based in Toronto, CA.

I'm really passionate about data analytics, and determined to improve my technical skills in Python, SQL, data viz and statistics 💻 Best to apply those skills with the business side!

***I'm still looking for the next 'super' team in Data Analytics in North America 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Feel free to send me a DM on LinkedIn for collab opportunities***
