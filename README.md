## Hi 👋 My name is Tee
### For friends who've known me, it's Thanh here!

I'm a **data analyst** (with marketing and HR Performance Management experiences) dubbed 'a dream chaser'🦸 Adapting to changes and always learning mean a lot to me 📚 I've made a long jouney from 🇻🇳 - 🇵🇭 - 🇨🇦 in the past few years 🌍 Now I'm based in Toronto, Canada 🍁

I'm really passionate about data analytics, and determined to improve my technical skills in Python, SQL, data viz, statistics, and Machine Learning 💻 Best to apply those skills with the business side knowledge I've had!

*🔭 I've finished university courses in Statistics, Python, SQL, and Data Organization at Ryerson University. I’ve also completed the Data Science Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs recently.*

**I'm also looking for an internship/associate position in Data Analytics & Business Intelligence in North America 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Please send me a DM on LinkedIn for any opportunity you may have!**
